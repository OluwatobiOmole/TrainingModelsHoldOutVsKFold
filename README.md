# Comparing Hold-Out and K-Fold Cross-Validation Methods
[View the Notebook](HoldOutVSKfold.ipynb)

## Introduction

Data splitting plays a crucial role in accurately measuring the performance of machine learning models. Two common approaches are:

- **Hold-Out Testing:** Splits the dataset into a training set and a testing set. However, with small datasets, this method can produce highly variable performance estimates.
- **K-Fold Cross-Validation:** Divides the dataset into `k` subsets, cycling through training and testing on each subset. This approach provides more stable and reliable performance estimates, particularly for smaller datasets.

### Objective
The goal of this experiment is to compare the stability and accuracy of prediction models built using **hold-out testing** and **k-fold cross-validation** on three datasets from the UCI repository:
- **Wine**
- **Seeds**
- **Ionosphere**

### Methodology
1. **Data-Splitting Techniques:** Evaluate and compare the two data-splitting methods.
2. **Machine Learning Models:** Apply four different models to reduce bias in the results:
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
   - Decision Trees
   - Naive Bayes
   - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
3. **Evaluation Metrics:** Analyze the stability and accuracy of each model's performance under both splitting techniques.

### Conclusion
This experiment aims to identify the optimal and most reliable data-splitting technique for small datasets, providing insights into the trade-offs between hold-out testing and k-fold cross-validation.
